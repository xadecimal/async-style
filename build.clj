    async: asynchronously running on the async-pool, await and others will park, use it for polling and small compute tasks
    blocking: asynchronously running on the blocking-pool, use it for running blocking operations and blocking io
    compute: asynchronously running on the compute-pool, use it for running heavy computation, don't block it
    settle(d): when a channel is delivered a value and closed, or in the case of a promise-chan, it means the promise-chan was fulfilled and will forever return the same value every time it is taken for and additional puts are ignored.
    fulfill(ed): when a channel is delivered a value, but not necessarily closed
    join(ed): when a channel returns a channel, joining is the process of further taking from the returned channel until a value is returned, thus unrolling a channel of channel of channel of ...
    async-pool: the core.async go block executor, it is fixed size, defaulting to 8 threads, don't soft or hard block it
