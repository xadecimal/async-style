## üî• Quick Start

```clojure
(ns example.core
  (:require [com.xadecimal.async-style :as a
             :refer [async blocking compute await wait cancel! cancelled?]]))

;; Simple async operation
(async
  (println "Sum:" (await (async (+ 1 2 3)))))

;; Blocking I/O, asynchronous waiting
(async
  (println (await (blocking
                    (Thread/sleep 500)
                    "Blocking completed!"))))

;; Blocking I/O, synchronous waiting
(println "Sync blocking result:"
         (wait (blocking
                 (Thread/sleep 500)
                 "Blocking sync done")))

;; Heavy compute, asynchronous waiting
(async
  (println "Factorial:"
           (await (compute (reduce * (range 1 20))))))

;; Heavy compute, synchronous waiting
(println "Sync compute factorial:"
         (wait (compute (reduce * (range 1 20)))))

;; Handle an error
(async
  (println "Divide:" (await (async (/ 1 0))))
  (catch ArithmeticException _
    (println "Can't divide by zero!")))

;; Cancel an operation
(let [task (blocking (Thread/sleep 5000)
                     (when-not (cancelled?)
                       (println "This won't print")))]

## Why async-style?

Core.async and the CSP style is powerful, but its `go` blocks and channels can feel low‚Äëlevel compared to JS Promises and async/await. **async-style** provides:

- **Familiar ergonomics**: `async`/`await` like in JavaScript, Python, C#, etc.
- **Expanded ergonomics**: `blocking`/`wait` for I/O and `compute`/`wait` for heavy compute.
- **Separate pools**: dedicated threads for async control flow (`async`), blocking I/O (`blocking`) and CPU‚Äëbound work (`compute`).
- **Built on core.async**: core.async under the hood, can be used alongside it, promises are core.async's `promise-chan`.
- **First-class error handling**: unlike core.async, errors are bubbled up and properly handled.
- **First‚Äëclass cancellation**: propagate cancellation through promise‚Äëchans.
- **Rich composition**: `then`, `chain`, `race`, `all`, `any`, `all-settled`.
- **Convenient macros**: `ado`, `alet`, `clet` for sequential, ordered, or concurrent binding.
- **Railway programming**: supports railway programming with `async`/`await*`, if preferred.

## Core Concepts

### Pools: `async`, `blocking`, `compute`

async-style follows the best practice outlined here: [Best practice for async/blocking/compute pools](https://gist.github.com/djspiewak/46b543800958cf61af6efa8e072bfd5c)

Meaning it offers `async`/`blocking`/`compute`, each are meant to specialize the work you will be doing so they get executed on a pool that is most optimal.

#### When used with core.async <= 1.7

| Macro      | Executor pool                           | Use for‚Ä¶                            |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `async`    | core.async‚Äôs go‚Äëdispatch (8 threads)    | async control flow | light CPU work |
| `blocking` | unbounded cached threads                | blocking I/O, sleeps                |
| `compute`  | fixed agent pool (cores + 2 threads)    | CPU‚Äëintensive work, do not block    |

#### When used with core.async >= 1.8

| Macro      | Executor pool                           | Use for‚Ä¶                            |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `async`    | unbounded cached threads                | async control flow | light CPU work |
| `blocking` | unbounded cached threads                | blocking I/O, sleeps                |
| `compute`  | fixed agent pool (cores + 2 threads)    | CPU‚Äëintensive work, do not block    |

#### When used with core.async >= 1.8 with virtual threads

| Macro      | Executor pool                           | Use for‚Ä¶                            |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `async`    | virtual thread executor                 | async control flow | light CPU work |
| `blocking` | virtual thread executor                 | blocking I/O, sleeps                |
| `compute`  | fixed agent pool (cores + 2 threads)    | CPU‚Äëintensive work, do not block    |

### Awaiting: `await`, `wait`, `await*`, `wait*`

- **`await`** (inside `async`): parks current go‚Äëthread until a promise‚Äëchan completes; re‚Äëthrows errors.
- **`wait`** (outside `async`): blocks calling thread for a result or error.
- **`await*` / `wait*`**: return exceptions as values (no throw).

`await` is like your JavaScript await, but just like core.async's `go`, it cannot park across function boundaries,
so you have to be careful when you use macros like `map` or `run!`, since those use higher-order functions,
you cannot `await` with them. This is true in JavaScript's await as well, but it's less common to use
higher-order functions in JS, so it doesn't feel as restrictive. Once core.async support for virtual thread is added, and if you run under a JDK that supports them, this limitation will go away.

`wait` is the counter-part to `await`, it is like `await` but synchronous. It doesn't color your functions, but will block your thread.

`await*` / `wait*` are variants that return the exception as a value, instead of throwing.

### Errors

#### Implicit `try` / `catch` / `finally`

All of `async`, `blocking`, `compute` and `await`:

1. **Automatically wrap** your body in a single `try` if you include any trailing
   `(catch ‚Ä¶)` or `(finally ‚Ä¶)` forms.
2. **Pull in** any `(catch Type e ‚Ä¶)` or `(finally ‚Ä¶)` at the end of your block
   into that `try`, so you don‚Äôt have to write it yourself.

```clojure
;; without implicit try, you‚Äôd need:
(async
  (try
    (/ 1 0)
    (catch ArithmeticException e
      (println "oops:" e))
    (finally
      (println "done"))))

;; with implicit try, just append catch/finally:
(async
  (/ 1 0)
  (catch ArithmeticException e
    (println "oops:" e))
  (finally
    (println "done")))
```

- Missing catch/finally? No wrapping is done (no overhead).
- Only catch or only finally? Works the same.
- Multiple catch? All are honored in order.

This gives you JS‚Äëstyle inline error handling right in your async blocks.

#### Error Handling Combinators

async-style gives you first‚Äëclass combinators to catch, recover, inspect or always run cleanup on errors:

- **`catch`**
  Intercept errors of a given type or predicate, return a fallback value:
  ```clojure
  ;; recover ArithmeticException to 0
  (-> (async (/ 1 0))
      (catch ArithmeticException (fn [_] 0)))
  ```

- **`finally`**
  Always run a side‚Äëeffect (cleanup, logging) on both success or error, then re‚Äëdeliver the original result or exception:
  ```clojure
  (-> (async (/ 1 0))
      (finally (fn [v] (println "Completed with" v))))
  ```

- **`handle`**
  Always invoke a single handler on the outcome (error or value) and deliver its return:
  ```clojure
  ;; log & wrap both success and error
  (-> (async (/ 1 0))
      (handle (fn [v] (str "Result:" v))))
  ```

- **`then`**
  Attach a success callback that is skipped if an error occurred (short‚Äëcircuits on error):
  ```clojure
  (-> (async 5)
      (then #(+ % 3))
      (then println))
  ```

- **`chain`**
  Shorthand for threading multiple `then` calls, with the same short‚Äëcircuit behavior:
  ```clojure
  (-> (async 5)
      (chain inc #(* 2 %) dec)
      (handle println))
  ```

#### Railway style with `await*` / `wait*`

By default `await`/`wait` will **throw** any exception taken from a chan. If you prefer **railway programming** (errors as values), use:

- **`await*`** (parking, non‚Äëthrowing)
- **`wait*`**  (blocking, non‚Äëthrowing)

They return either the successful value *or* the `Throwable`. Functions `error?` and `ok?` can than be used to branch on their result:

```clojure
(async
  (let [result (await* (async (/ 1 0)))]
    (if (error? result)
      (println "Handled error:" (ex-message result))
      (println "Success:" result))))
```

Errors are always modeled this way in async-chan, unlike in JS which wraps errors in a map, in async-style they are either an error? or an ok? result:

```clojure
(async
  (let [vals (await* (all-settled [(async 1) (async (/ 1 0)) (async 3)]))]
    (println
      (map (fn [v] (if (error? v) :err v)) vals))))
;; ‚áí (1 :err 3)
```

### Cancellation

Cancellation in **async-style** is **cooperative**‚Äîyou signal it with `cancel!`, but your code must check for it to actually stop.

- **`cancel!`**
  ```clojure
  (cancel! ch)              ; cancel with CancellationException
  (cancel! ch custom-val)   ; cancel with custom-val (must not be nil)
  ```
  Marks the promise‚Äëchan `ch` as cancelled. If the block hasn‚Äôt started, it immediately fulfills; otherwise it waits for you to check.

- **`cancelled?`**
  ```clojure
  (when-not (cancelled?) ‚Ä¶)
  ```
  Returns `true` inside `async`/`blocking`/`compute` if `cancel!` was called. Does **not** throw.

- **`check-cancelled!`**
  ```clojure
  (check-cancelled!)  ; throws CancellationException if cancelled
  ```
  Throws immediately when cancelled, so you can use it at safe points to short‚Äëcircuit heavy loops or I/O.

- **Handling cancellation downstream**
  - `await` / `wait` will re‚Äëthrow the `CancellationException` (or return your custom val).

```clojure
(def work
  (async
    (loop [i 0]
      (check-cancelled!)
      (println "step" i)
      (recur (inc i)))))

;; let it run a bit‚Ä¶
(Thread/sleep 50)
(cancel! work)

;; downstream:
(async
  (await work)
  (catch CancellationException _
    (println "Work was cancelled!")))
```

| `all-settled` | Wait for all, return vector of all results or errors                      |

### Helpers: `ado`, `alet`, `clet`, `time`

| Macro | Description                                                                                                      |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ado` | Execute expressions one after another, awaiting each; returns a promise‚Äëchan of the last expression.             |
| `alet`| Like `let` but each binding is awaited in order before evaluating the body.                                      |
| `clet`| Concurrent `let`: evaluates all bindings in parallel, auto‚Äëawaiting any dependencies between them.               |
| `time`| Measure wall‚Äëclock time of a sync or async expression; prints the elapsed ms and returns the expression‚Äôs value. |

### Asynchronous `let` (`alet`) and Concurrent `let` (`clet`)

Bind async expressions just like a normal `let`‚Äîbut choose between sequential or parallel evaluation:

| Macro  | Semantics                                                                                                                                   |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `alet` | **Sequential**: awaits each binding in order before evaluating the next.                                                                    |
| `clet` | **Concurrent**: starts all bindings in parallel, auto‚Äëawaiting any that depend on previous ones while letting independent bindings overlap. |

#### `alet` example

```clojure
(alet
  [a (defer 100 1)
   b (defer 100 2)
   c (defer 100 3)]
  (println "Sum =" (+ a b c)))
;; Prints "Sum = 6" after ~300¬†ms
```

#### `clet` example

```clojure
(clet
  [a (defer 100 1)
   b (defer a   2)   ;; waits for `a`
   c (defer 100 3)]  ;; independent of `a` and `b`
  (println "Sum =" (+ a b c)))
;; Prints "Sum = 6" after ~200¬†ms (a and c run in parallel; b waits on a)
```

- Use **`alet`** when bindings must run in sequence.
- Use **`clet`** to maximize concurrency, with dependencies automatically respected.
